# Reach New Heights with the Cloud
## Introduction
As onsite servers become outdated, dental practices have been turning to **cloud-based practice management software** to increase efficiency and scalability. 
__*Cloud-based software*__ is more accessible, secure, and able to transfer data easily, __making it an even more desirable option for dental practices__. 
However, there are some *things to consider* before making the _switch to the cloud_. 
Here are some points to help _**guide you on your journey**_.
>The Benefits of Moving Your Dental Practice Management Software to the Cloud Are Clear.

On-premise ~~practice management~~ software was once very popular but is now losing favor to cloud-based solutions. 
Unlike cloud-based systems, on-site software requires multiple products for `patient communication`, imaging, claims management, analytics, and more, to support the entire practice. This can be very costly, and the real-time data transmission necessary for efficient practice operation is not possible. 
There is also a greater risk of patient data being [exposed](www.google.com) to the public.
